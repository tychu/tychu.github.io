subtitle: Data Science Matser student from RWTH Aachen

I am a highly motivated person currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at RWTH Aachen University. Driven by a passion for leveraging data and AI techniques to solve real-world problems, My experience spans various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing and automatic speech recognition.

Previously, I was a master’s thesis student at IMEC, working on an object detection task under the supervision of [Benjamin Berkels](https://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/mathematik/fachgruppe/institute-lehrstuehle/personen/~bkbg/mitarbeiter-campus-/?gguid=PER-B2KP28J&allou=1) and [Hichem Sahli](https://researchportal.vub.be/en/persons/hichem-sahli).
I completed an internship at BMW Group as a data analytics intern, where I contributed to the digital transformation of the HR department.

When I’m not working on machine learning, I enjoy watching F1 and tennis, reading novels, and immersing myself in old movies.
