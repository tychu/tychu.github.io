### Master thesis at IMEC

This master's thesis investigates end-to-end deep learning models for radar-based object detection, focusing on directly processing raw Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) data. The research compares this approach to traditional methods using pre-processed radar data, such as Range-Doppler maps. Several novel model architectures are proposed and evaluated, including Extended T-FFTRadNet and ADAT-FFTRadNet, which incorporate advanced techniques like Swin Transformers and adaptive-directional attention. The study uses a simulated radar dataset for training and testing, and results demonstrate the potential advantages of processing raw ADC data for improved accuracy and efficiency in object detection. The thesis concludes by suggesting avenues for future research to optimize the proposed models.

### Internship in BMW Group

- Built language models (Sentence BERT) for sentence similarity tasks via **Python, Docker, and Git**
- Developing and deploying sentence similarity API on the server via **Python and Ubuntu OS command**
- Built interactive business analytic dashboard for HR Analytic Use Cases via **Tableau**

I am deeply interested in exploring various areas of machine learning and implement it to solve real-world problems.This curiosity led me to take courses across different fields and pursue an NLP-focused internship at BMW. During the FUMA project, I played a pivotal role in a data analytics project centered on the digital transformation of the Human Resource department. My responsibilities included identifying and analyzing challenges within the HR department, conducting comprehensive research to devise suitable solutions sourced from academic papers and articles.

During my internship, I help to drive the digital transformation on HR processes via deep learning model. I deployed a multilingual sentence-BERT model to identify similar documents, significantly reducing the need for manual searches. I tested the model with public and the company dataset to ensure the model performance. I also adapted the model for server deployment using FastAPI, so that our colleague could use the prototype implementation for sentence similarity.This experience taught me how to analyze and solve real-world problems while effectively communicating with colleagues, understanding their needs, and meeting their requirements.
