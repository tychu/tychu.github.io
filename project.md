### Master thesis at IMEC

![ADAS](/assets/img/ADAS.png)

This master's thesis investigates **end-to-end deep learning models for radar-based object detection**, focusing on directly processing raw Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) data. The research compares this approach to traditional methods using pre-processed radar data, such as Range-Doppler maps. Several **novel model architectures are proposed and evaluated**, including Extended T-FFTRadNet and ADAT-FFTRadNet, which incorporate advanced techniques like Swin Transformers and adaptive-directional attention. 

The study uses a simulated radar dataset for training and testing, and **results demonstrate the potential advantages of processing raw ADC data for improved accuracy and efficiency in object detection**. The thesis concludes by suggesting avenues for future research to optimize the proposed models.

### Internship in BMW Group

I worked as a Data Analytics Intern in the Process, Digitization and Governance Department at BMW Group in Munich, Germany from March 2022 to August 2022. During this internship, Chu played a key role in a data analytics project focused on the digital transformation of the Human Resource department.

My responsibilities included:  
• Identifying and analyzing challenges within the HR department.  
• Conducting comprehensive research to devise suitable solutions based on academic papers and articles.  
• **Deploying a multilingual sentence-BERT model** to identify similar documents, reducing the need for manual searches.  
• Testing the model with public and company datasets to ensure its performance.  
• Adapting the model for server deployment using FastAPI to create a sentence similarity prototype.  

This internship experience taught me how to analyze and solve real-world problems, communicate effectively with non-technical colleagues, understand their needs, and meet their requirements. I discovered a passion for helping others using data or AI techniques.
