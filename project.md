## Master thesis at IMEC

![ADAS](/assets/img/ADAS.png)

This master's thesis investigates **end-to-end deep learning models for radar-based object detection**, focusing on directly processing raw Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) data. The research compares this approach to traditional methods using pre-processed radar data, such as Range-Doppler maps. Several **novel model architectures are proposed and evaluated**, including Extended T-FFTRadNet and ADAT-FFTRadNet, which incorporate advanced techniques like Swin Transformers and adaptive-directional attention. 

The study uses a simulated radar dataset for training and testing, and **results demonstrate the potential advantages of processing raw ADC data for improved accuracy and efficiency in object detection**. The thesis concludes by suggesting avenues for future research to optimize the proposed models.

I worked as a Data Analytics Intern in the Process, Digitization and Governance Department at BMW Group in Munich, Germany from March 2022 to August 2022. During this internship, I played a key role in a data analytics project focused on the **digital transformation of the Human Resource department**.

My responsibilities included:  
• Identifying and analyzing challenges within the HR department.  
• Conducting comprehensive research to devise suitable solutions based on academic papers and articles.  
• **Deploying a multilingual sentence-BERT model** to identify similar documents, reducing the need for manual searches.  
• Testing the model with public and company datasets to ensure its performance.  
• Adapting the model for server deployment using FastAPI to create a sentence similarity prototype.  

This internship experience taught me how to analyze and solve real-world problems, communicate effectively with non-technical colleagues, understand their needs, and meet their requirements. I discovered a passion for helping others using data or AI techniques.

## Pac-Man project

This is a project for the Fundamental AI course at KU Leuven.

The goal of this project is to implement Artificial Intelligence search algorithms for Pac-Man to control its path using Python code within a well-structured Pac-Man game.

This project is derived from [Berkeley AI project](https://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html), focusing on implementing various search algorithms within a Pac-Man game framework. Students are tasked with **creating depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform-cost search, and A search algorithms in Python**, testing them on different maze layouts and complexities. The project further challenges students to **develop heuristics for more complex scenarios, such as finding all the corners of a maze or eating all the dots efficiently**, emphasizing the importance of efficient search strategies and algorithm design. Finally, students explore suboptimal search strategies as a means to quickly find solutions to difficult problems.

The seminar "Selected Topics in Human Language Technology and Machine Learning" at Lehrstuhl Informatik 6, RWTH Aachen University, involves a structured process for students to deeply understand and present a chosen topic in the field of human language technology and machine learning.

This report is **exploring methods for integrating language models (LMs) into end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems**.  It examines both external LM integration techniques, such as Shallow, Cold, and Component Fusion, and internal LM methods, including the Density Ratio method and Hybrid Autoregressive Transducer. This report presents a **theoretical background on ASR and LMs, details various LM integration approaches, and analyzes experimental results comparing their effectiveness in improving ASR accuracy**, particularly in target domains different from the training data.  The work concludes by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and suggesting future research directions.

**Seminar Structure and Achievements:**

* **Topic Selection and Proposal:** Initially, students selected from a list of provided topics, with the option to propose their own. I chosen topic, **End-to-End ASR LM Integration**, supervised by Simon Berger.  A formal proposal was submitted and revised based on feedback.

* **Literature Review and Critical Analysis:** I conducted a comprehensive literature review, examining seminal works and state-of-the-art methods in my chosen area.  The references provided in the seminar description served as a starting point. I critically analyzed the selected papers,  identifying key concepts, strengths, limitations, and relationships between different approaches.

* **Written Report:** I synthesized my research findings into a roughly 20-page article, written in LaTeX format. This article delved into the details of End-to-End ASR LM Integration, covering various aspects like problem definition, existing approaches, mathematical formulations, and experimental results. The report demonstrated my ability to synthesize information from various sources and present it in a clear and organized manner.

* **Presentation Preparation:** I created a presentation in LaTeX, consisting of 20-30 slides, summarizing my research and key findings for an oral presentation. The presentation included an overview of the relevant literature, clear illustrations of important concepts, and a discussion of experimental results.  Emphasis was placed on clarity, conciseness, and visual aids to effectively convey information.

* **Trial Presentation and Feedback:**  I participated in trial presentations, where I presented my work to my supervisor and peers, receiving valuable feedback. This step helped refine my presentation skills and ensure the clarity and coherence of my arguments.

* **Final Presentation:** I delivered a 30-40 minute presentation on my chosen topic to the seminar audience, followed by a 15-minute discussion. This demonstrated my ability to effectively communicate complex technical information to a knowledgeable audience.  The final article and presentation slides were submitted after incorporating any necessary corrections.

* **Seminar Participation:**  I attended all presentation sessions, actively engaging in discussions, asking questions, and providing insights.  This showed ,y commitment to learning from my peers and contributing to the overall seminar experience.

By successfully completing these steps, I acquired in-depth knowledge in End-to-End ASR LM Integration, honed my research, analytical, writing, and presentation skills, and actively contributed to a collaborative learning environment.
