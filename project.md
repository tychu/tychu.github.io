### Master thesis at IMEC

- Topics: Radar Image Reconstruction with raw ADC  data
- Implemented and altered the end-to-end Swin Vision Transformer model (T-FFTRadNet) for object detection task via **Python(Pytorch, Optuna (with PostgreSQL), wandb and ddp)**
- Trained the model on the server via **NoMachine and Ubuntu OS command**
- Simulated MIMO FMCW raw ADC data via **MATLAB**

To broaden my expertise, I chose to focus on computer vision for my masterâ€™s thesis rather than continuing exclusively in NLP. My thesis at IMEC tackled an object detection task, reconstructing images from raw ADC (analog-to-digital converter) radar data using deep learning models.To enhance performance beyond the state-of-the-art model,T-FFTRadNet, I introduced several innovations.

### Internship in BMW Group

- Built language models (Sentence BERT) for sentence similarity tasks via **Python, Docker, and Git**
- Developing and deploying sentence similarity API on the server via **Python and Ubuntu OS command**
- Built interactive business analytic dashboard for HR Analytic Use Cases via **Tableau**

I am deeply interested in exploring various areas of machine learning and implement it to solve real-world problems.This curiosity led me to take courses across different fields and pursue an NLP-focused internship at BMW. During the FUMA project, I played a pivotal role in a data analytics project centered on the digital transformation of the Human Resource department. My responsibilities included identifying and analyzing challenges within the HR department, conducting comprehensive research to devise suitable solutions sourced from academic papers and articles.

During my internship, I help to drive the digital transformation on HR processes via deep learning model. I deployed a multilingual sentence-BERT model to identify similar documents, significantly reducing the need for manual searches. I tested the model with public and the company dataset to ensure the model performance. I also adapted the model for server deployment using FastAPI, so that our colleague could use the prototype implementation for sentence similarity.This experience taught me how to analyze and solve real-world problems while effectively communicating with colleagues, understanding their needs, and meeting their requirements.
