Ting-Ying Chu is a highly motivated Data Science master's student at RWTH Aachen University with a strong interest in AI applications and a passion for leveraging data and AI techniques to solve real-world problems. Chu's academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics from National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.  During the master's program at RWTH Aachen University, Chu participated in an **Erasmus Exchange Program at KU Leuven** in Belgium. This program exposed Chu to key areas such as Natural Language Processing, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence, Linguistic and Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed Systems. Chu's master's studies at RWTH Aachen University focused on courses such as **Mathematical Methods of Signal and Image Processing**, Machine Learning, and Concepts and Models for Parallel and Data-centric Programming. 

Chu's professional experience is equally impressive. They have worked as a Research Assistant at Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University, focusing on projects related to pollution prediction, ocean wave modeling, and drug use prediction. Chu also gained valuable experience as a Junior Specialist at Cathay Bank, where they led customer behavior prediction projects, built data visualization dashboards, and contributed to the development of a real-time decision platform. Notably, Chu's **internship at BMW Group provided them with hands-on experience in driving digital transformation through deep learning models**. Beyond the university setting, **Chu completed a master's thesis project at imec, a research and innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital technologies**. This experience involved implementing and altering the end-to-end Swin Vision Transformer model (T-FFTRadNet) for object detection using raw ADC data for radar image reconstruction. At BMW, Chu successfully deployed a multilingual sentence-BERT model to enhance HR processes, showcasing their ability to analyze, solve real-world problems, and communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders.
